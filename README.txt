CFFI interface/python module package for phantompy using the library shared object.

An experiment that may prove really useful and a good exercise into learning CFFI and friends.

Currently the setup.py can (tested) get the master branch of phantompy (for the C++ library) or download a zip of it.

TODO:

- add develop Command to setup.py so I can modify and test rapidly (like pyramid)
- get page working
- everything else.
